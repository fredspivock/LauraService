	"description": "In its third edition, the award winning Earn Your Wings is a leaderboard-focused competition that offers badges and points for completing tasks. Based on flight travel, users earn Aeroplan miles for flights booked inside the parameters of the promotion. My role oversaw the site redesign, updates to visual assets, and enhancements of the user profile section. By adding stats and facts, participants returned to the site more often and it also increased competition among users. The airline saw an overwhelming 875% ROI and reached 20,000 top-tier flyers.",
