	"description": "Canada’s Mercedes-Benz magazine is created by Spafax’s in-house team of editors and designers. The website is the first to be built independently of its German headquarters and features all Canadian-made content. By collaborating with the art director and editor-in-chief, I translated the already beautiful magazine into a custom online reading experience. By designing a sitemap, wireframes, and mockups I was able to elegantly present the varying article types. I also created behavioural guidelines to give the website and navigation a premium feel.",
