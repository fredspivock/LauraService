	"description": "For 13 years running, Air Canada’s enRoute magazine has ranked the top ten new restaurants in the country. The award-winning in-flight magazine and travel media brand is an authority for the global traveller and reaches over one million readers each month. The November, Food & Drink issue is one of the magazine’s most anticipated releases and is picked up by media outlets across Canada.<br/><br/>I integrated the print product to web by designing a custom and responsive microsite to fit consistently with the regular enRoute site. We added extra content this year to bring more readers online. New features included a quiz, videos for the top-three restaurants, a soundtrack with a curated song for each of the top-ten restaurants, and extra photos not featured in the magazine (some with clickable hotspots revealing extra content). I also did photo research, working with the photographer to select additional images featured solely on the website.",
