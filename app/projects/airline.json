	"description": "The Altitude Community is an exclusive platform where Air Canada’s frequent flyers can share travel tips. Members can make lists of their favourite hotels, bars, restaurants, and sights anywhere in the world or browse recommendations written by other members. The rigorous planning, execution and testing of the beta site took more than a year. Designing a social media platform from scratch required extensive research and a comprehensive competitive analysis of other social networks. Rather than trying to reinvent the wheel we took insight and solutions from our research and reused or reconfigured simple patterns and features which we observed across multiple social networks. I provided direction on the team by aiding with concept development, endless sketching of UI patterns, designing multiple iterations of sitemaps, wireframes and mockups, selecting imagery, designing assets, storyboarding, diagramming behaviours and usability-testing.",
