	"description": "Penny Black Media, a distributor of independent feature films for the worldwide airline market, wanted to establish a website that is helpful to their global clientele lists and retained their brandâ€™s familiarity in the online environment. The site needed to allow their clients to easily find films in their ever-growing catalogue, and allow for both public and private access to film information and screeners. I provided this by continually tweaking and challenging the design of a sitemap, wireframes and design mockups until we were successful in providing an elegant, easy-to-use and responsive website.<br/><br/>By working closely with the client we solidified a relationship with a fellow WPP company  and after the unveiling of this new product that we built together with the Penny Black Media team in Southern California. Cathie Trotta, Managing Director for Penny Black Media, said:<br/><br/>Working with Spafax Interactive was a stimulating, collaborative experience. They successfully translated our vision into a look and feel that is perfectly on target with the Penny Black Media brand. We are more than pleased with our new website.",
