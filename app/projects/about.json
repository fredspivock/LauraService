	"description": "I enjoy challenging web projects; couple this with my love for design and you have a bona fide interaction designer. I have all the usual passions: good typography, content organisation, interface design and usability. For the past three years I have put these to use while immersed in an interactive team at Spafax, a WPP-owned content marketing agency. At Spafax I shaped responsive and engaging web experiences. Understanding how real people are going to use a website is another passion of mine. I like watching users interact with a website that I have designed. Understanding a user’s experience helps me find potential problems in a site’s complex navigation system and create solutions early in the design process. Frank Chimero says, “People ignore design that ignores people.” Frank’s got a good point.<br/><br/>I started as a freelancer at Spafax &#8212; I was given simple tasks like designing internal infographics, social media campaigns, banner images for articles, and ads. It didn’t take long before those smaller tasks morphed into big projects. After a few months, the freelance gig was up, and I was hired as one of the few full-time designers at the company.<br/><br/>Soon after, I was designing websites from scratch for one of Spafax’s blue-chip clients. These early encounters with UI/UX design were formative. I developed a fascination with the complex nature of designing for the browser. I enjoyed getting my hands dirty and being involved in the process, from ideation to testing, right through to deployment and beyond. It was a huge learning curve, filled with a lot of hard work, late nights, and teaching myself new skills to get the job done.<br/><br/>I aided in the growth of the department by helping with pitches and conceptualizing projects for new and existing clients. As the department grew, I was overseeing multiple projects with tight deadlines and providing direction for new designers. This improved my ability to present and rationalize design decisions. At the same time, I was testing and learning new UI/UX tools and software on behalf of our growing department. All of this gave me a keen eye for high-standard design work and providing critical feedback to the team.<br/><br/>My work experience up until this point has been fulfilling. Designing systems that a lot of people use and enjoy is very rewarding. I want to continue developing great digital campaigns for interesting projects and companies. Making web products that work well, look amazing and are delightful to use is a priority for me. I would also like to continue learning new skills—specifically, I am curious about designing mobile applications, experimenting with animation and taking on more branding and identity projects.",
