	"description": "I have a passion for design, typography and imagery. By focussing on simplicity, clarity, functionality and attention to detail, I create responsive web experiences that users will (first) enjoy and (second) hardly notice. For the past three years I have been able to use these obsessions while being immersed in an interactive team at Spafax, a WPP owned content marketing agency. Working alongside people who make engaging and entertaining media products has given me the tools and experience to thrive as a professional designer of custom web products.<br/><br/> Design is solving problems and my process for interaction design focuses on creating engaging interfaces with well thought out behaviours. I love understanding how users and technology connect with each other. With this understanding, I can anticipate how someone will interact with a system, letting me find and fix problems early and invent new solutions.",
