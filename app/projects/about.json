	"description": "I really like complexity and figuring things out, couple this with my love for minimalist design and you have a bona fide interaction designer. I have all the usual passions: good typography, content organisation, interface design and usability. For the past three years I have put these fascinations to use while immersed in an interactive team at Spafax, a WPP-owned content marketing agency. At Spafax I shaped responsive and engaging web experiences. One of my “aha” moments in my job was watching real people use a website that I designed. It helped me understand why and how an audience would react and respond to technology. This helped me find potential problems in the site’s complex navigation system and invent solutions early in the design process. Frank Chimero says, “People ignore design that ignores people.” Frank’s got a good point.<br/><br/>I started as a freelancer at Spafax -- I was given simple tasks like designing internal infographics, social media campaigns, banner images for articles, and ads. It didn’t take long before those smaller tasks morphed into big projects. After a few months, the freelance gig was up and I was hired as one of the few full-time designers at the company.<br/><br/>Soon after, I was designing websites from scratch for one of Spafax’s blue-chip clients. These early encounters with UI/UX design were formative. I developed a fascination with the complex nature of designing for the browser. I enjoyed getting my hands dirty and being involved in the process, from ideation to testing, right through to deployment and beyond. It was a huge learning curve, a lot of hard work, late nights, and teaching myself new skills to get the job done.<br/><br/>Then the department got busy. Very busy. Ten new people were hired and the company’s growth in turn helped me grow, too. Suddenly I was working on an evolving team, overseeing multiple projects with tight deadlines, and developing a keen eye for high-standard design work (under the mentorship of designer and Digital Director, Charles Lim).<br/><br/>My ability to write, present and rationalize design decisions improved, I was testing and learning new UI/UX tools and software. It was a stimulating environment  teamwork and collaboration proved invaluable for the growing department -- you know the saying, “two heads is better than not creating award-winning work.” <br/><br/>Anyways, I was getting to design systems that people were going to use, and a lot of people, so I made sure it worked well, looked amazing and was a delight to use. I usually enjoyed doing it, too.",
